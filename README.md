# Project Overview

*In this Netflix data analysis project, I performed an in-depth exploration of a Netflix dataset using Python. The dataset contained information about TV shows and movies available on Netflix. This project showcases data cleaning, visualization, querying, and interpretation. It provides valuable insights into Netflix content trends, ratings, and more.*


## Python Libaries Used
### *pandas, seaborn, datetime, Label encoder*

### Data Cleaning:

Task 1: Checked for and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.</br>
Task 2: Detected and visualized null values using a heat map to identify missing data patterns.</br>

Q5: Extracted titles of TV shows released only in India.</br>
Q6: Identified the top 10 directors contributing the most content to Netflix.</br>

### Advanced Queries and Analysis:

Q7: Extracted records with either 'Movie' and 'Comedies' type or 'TV Show' and 'United Kingdom' country.</br>
Q8: Counted the movies/shows featuring Tom Cruise.</br>
Q9: Explored different Netflix ratings and their distributions.</br>

Q9.1: Calculated the count of 'TV-14' rated movies in Canada.</br>
Q9.2: Counted 'R' rated TV shows released after 2018.

### Data Insights:

Q10: Determined the maximum duration of a movie/TV show on Netflix.</br>
Q11: Identified the country with the highest number of TV shows.</br>
Q12: Explored how to sort the dataset by year.</br>
Q13: Filtered instances meeting specific criteria (e.g., 'Movie' and 'Dramas', or 'TV Show' and 'Kids TV').</br>
Q14: Distribution of Movie and TV Show</br>
