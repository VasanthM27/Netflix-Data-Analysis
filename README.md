# Project Overview

*In this Netflix data analysis project, I performed an in-depth exploration of a Netflix dataset using Python. The dataset contained information about TV shows and movies available on Netflix. This project showcases data cleaning, visualization, querying, and interpretation. It provides valuable insights into Netflix content trends, ratings, and more.*


## Python Libaries Used
### *pandas, seaborn, datetime, Label encoder*

### Data Cleaning:

Task 1: Checked for and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.</br>
Task 2: Detected and visualized null values using a heat map to identify missing data patterns.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:

Q1: Found the Show ID and Director of the TV show 'House of Cards'.</br>
Q2: Determined the year with the highest number of TV shows and movies released, visualized with a bar graph.</br>
Q3: Created a bar graph displaying the count of movies and TV shows in the dataset.

### Filtering and Retrieval:

Q4: Listed movies released in the year 2000.</br>
Q5: Extracted titles of TV shows released only in India.</br>
Q6: Identified the top 10 directors contributing the most content to Netflix.

### Advanced Queries and Analysis:

Q9: Explored different Netflix ratings and their distributions.</br>
Q9.1: Calculated the count of 'TV-14' rated movies in Canada.</br>
Q9.2: Counted 'R' rated TV shows released after 2018.

### Data Insights:

Q10: Determined the maximum duration of a movie/show on Netflix.</br>
Q11: Identified the country with the highest number of TV shows.</br>
Q12: Explored how to sort the dataset by year.</br>
Q13: Filtered instances meeting specific criteria (e.g., 'Movie' and 'Dramas', or 'TV Show' and 'Kids TV').
